	public $MetaDesc = 'Biometrics refer to the unique physical and behavioral traits of individuals that are unique in nature. For example, physical traits include face, iris, fingerprints, etc. and common behavioral traits include voiceprint, gait, signature, keystroke dynamics, and so on. Biometric authentication is the technology used to identify individuals based on their biometrics.

 Biometric-based techniques have emerged as the most promising options for recognizing individuals in recent years. Instead of authenticating people and granting them access to physical and virtual domains based on passwords, PINs, smart cards, keys, tokens and so forth, these methods examine an individual’s physiological and/or behavioral characteristics in order to determine and/or ascertain his identity. Passwords and PINs are hard to remember, easy to forget and can be guessed or stolen; cards, tokens can be misplaced, forgotten or duplicated; cards with magnetic strips can become corrupted and unreadable. However, an individual’s biological traits cannot be misplaced, forgotten, stolen or forged, and thus they provide a more secure and reliable means of authentication than the traditional methods. ';
